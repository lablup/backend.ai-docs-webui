My Environments
===============

From 24.03, a new \"My Environments\" page for users has been introduced.
This page displays contents such as a list of images created by the user's
:ref:`session commits<session-commit>`.

On the Images tab of the My Environments page, user can manage customized
images used in creating compute sessions. This tab displays meta information
of images converted from computation sessions to images. User can view details
such as the registry, architecture, namespace, language, version, base,
constraint, digest, and other information for each image.

.. _delete-customized-image:

To delete an image, click on the red trash button in the control column.
After deletion, you will not be able to create a new session using that image.

bottom right of the table. Then you can see below dialog to select the columns
you want to see.
