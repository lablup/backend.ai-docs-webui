=============================================
Mounting Folders to a Compute Session
=============================================

.. _session-mounts:

Backend.AI provides a function to mount storage folders when creating a compute session.
When new compute session is started, user will have access to the``/home/work/`` directory.
Normal directories and files created under ``/home/work/`` will disappear when the compute session is terminated.
This is because compute sessions are dynamically created and deleted based on the container.
To preserve data inside a container regardless of the container's lifecycle, a separate host folder must be mounted in the container, and then files must be created within the mounted folder.

Go to 'Sessions' page and click the 'Start' button. 
After filling out the 'Session Type', 'Environments & Resource allocation' steps, 
navigate to the 'Data & Storage' step to see a list of folders that users can mount. 
From this list, choose the folders to mount and add them, or select multiple folders to mount more. 
The documentation will explain how to mount two folders, ``user1-ml-test`` and ``user2-vfolder``, 
and then create a session.

.. note::
   By looking at the data and folder information within that project, users can see information such as usage mode, 
   the storage host the folder belongs to, permissions, and more. 
   Note that the 'Data & Storage' step only outputs data folders that are mountable by the current user. 
   For example, folders that belong to other projects cannot be viewed. 
.. note::
   Clicking a 'folder name' in the 'Data & Storage' step will open the folder explorer for that folder. 
   From this, users can view the folders that have been created, create new folders, and upload files. 
   For more detailed instructions related to folders, please refer :ref:`Explore Folder<explore_folder>` section. 

   Alternatively, a new virtual folder can be created by clicking the '+' button. 
   For further information on how to create a new folder in session launcher page, 
   please refer :ref:`Create storage folder<create_storage_folder>` section. 

In the created session, screen terminal window can be brought up by clicking the terminal icon. 
``ls`` command will mount ``user1-ml-test` folder and ``user2-vfolder`` under the ``user1-ml-test`` 
and ``user2-vfolder`` folders are mounted under the home directory.

.. note::
   The selected folder will be mounted with its name under ``/home/work/`` inside the compute session, by its default. 
   For example, if folder's name is ``test``, it is mounted on ``/home/work/test``. 
   To customize the mount path, write an absolute path in the 'Path and Alias' input fields. 
   Writing ``/workspace`` in the input field of the ``test`` folder will mount to ``/workspace`` inside the session. 
   Writing a relative path will mount the folder under ``/home/work/`` with the path. 

Backend.AI gives an option to preserve files in folders when a compute session is deleted. 
The example below illustrates what's happening. 

Under the ``user2-vfolder``, create a ``test_file``.
Fill the contents with \"file inside user2-vfolder\".

Running ``ls`` command against ``user2-vfolder``, users can confirm the file was created successfully. 
Please note the contents of the file can be chekced with ``cat`` command. 

Now delete the compute session and go to the Storage page. 
Locate the ``user2-vfolder folder``, open a file explorer and check that the ``test_file`` exists. 
Click the 'download' button in 'Actions' tab to download the file to the local machine and open it 
to confirm that the contents are \"file inside user2-vfolder\".

Performing file management on a mounted folder when you create a compute session, 
data can be preserved even after users ends the compute session. 


.. _using-automount-folder:

Configure a compute session environment using an automount folder
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If a new program or library is required that is not pre-installed in a compute session, a Storage folder attribute and :ref:`automount-folder<automount-folder>`, 
which is independent of the compute session lifecycle, can be used to install the package. 
Configure a consistent environment regardless of the type of compute session. 

.. _using-pip-with-automountfolder:

Install Python packages via pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating a folder named ``.local`` allows a user to install Python user packages in same folder. 
``pip`` by default installs the packages in the ``.local`` folder under the user's home folder 
(Please note that automount folder is mounted under user's home folder). 
So, to keep a Python package called ``tqdm`` installed at all times, regardless of the computing environment, 
a command like the following could be issued from the terminal: 

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install tqdm

After that, when a new compute session is created, the ``.local`` folder where the ``tqdm`` package 
is installed is automatically mounted, so users can use it without reinstalling the ``tqdm`` package.

.. warning::

   When using multiple Python versions or sessions with different Python versions, packages may have compatibility issues. 
   This can be circumvented by branching ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable via the ``.bashrc``. 
   This is because the user's ``pip`` package is installed in the path specified in the ``PYTHONPATH``.

.. _using-linuxbrew-with-automountfolder:

Install packages via Homebrew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Package managers like Ubuntu ``apt`` or CentOS ``yum`` usually require the ``root`` permission. 
For security reasons, ``sudo`` and ``root`` accesses are blocked by default in Backend.AI's compute session (Depending on the configuration, this may be allowed), so we recommend to use `Homebrew on Linux <https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux>`_ which does not require ``sudo``.

Homebrew can be configured as follows: 

- Create ``.linuxbrew`` folder in Data & Storage page.
- Create a compute session (``.linuxbrew`` folder is automatically mounted at
  ``/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew``).
- Install Homebrew in the compute session, if not yet installed.

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

- Homebrew packages can be installed like following:

   .. code-block:: shell

      $ brew install hello
      $ hello
      Hello, world!

``brew`` installs packages under ``/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew`` which is automatically mounted when ``.linuxbrew`` folder exists. 
So, if an automount folder named ''.linuxbrew'' is created, the Homebrew packages previously installed can be used again, even if the compute session is deleted and a new compute session is created.
