Handling Data & Storage Folders
===============================

Backend.AI supports dedicated storage to preserve user's files. Since the files
and directories of a compute session are deleted upon session termination, it is
recommended to save them in a storage folder. List of storage folders can be
found by selecting the Data & Storage page on the sidebar. You can see the information
such as the folder name and ID, the NFS host name where the folder is located
(Location), and folder access rights (Permission).

   :alt: Folder list in Storage page

There are two types of storage folders. User folders can be created by
normal users, and you can see that there is one user icon in the Type panel.
On the other hand, Group folders can be recognized by an icon with multiple
users in the panel. Group folders are created by domain admins, and normal
users can only see group folders created for the group in which the users
belong.

Storage Status on top of the folder list shows the following information:

* Created: The number of folders that the user created.
* Invited: The number of folers that the user was invited to share.
* Capacity: The maximum number of folders that the user can create afterwards.
  This value depends on the resource policy applied to the user and cannot be changed
  without changing the resource policy. Folders that were not created by the user (eg. folders invited to share, or group folders) are not counted.

Check marks on the Owner panel in the folder list indicate the user created folders.

Create storage folder
---------------------

You can create a storage folder with the desired name by clicking the NEW FOLDER
button. Enter the name of the folder to be created in Folder name, and select
one of User / Group for Type. (Depending on the server settings, only one of
User or Group may be selectable.) When creating a group folder, the Group field
must be set. The group folder will be bound to the group specified in the Group
field, and only users belonging to the group can mount and use the group folder.
After setting the values as desired, you can create a folder by clicking the
CREATE button.

   :alt: Folder creation dialog

The meaning of each fields that can be selected in the creation dialog is as
follows.

* Folder name: The name of the folder. You can enter up to 64 characters.
* Host: NFS host to create folder. You can choose one if you have multiple NFS
  hosts.
* Type: Determines the type of folder to be created. It can be set as User or
  Group. The User folder is a folder that users can create and use alone
  and the Group folder is a folder created by admin and shared by users in the group.
* Usage Mode: You can set the purpose of the folder. There are three types of mode:
  General, Data, and Model. It is classified for the development of exclusive functions
  for Data & Model Stores in the future and currently there is no
  difference in UI depending on the purpose.
* Group: Designates the group to which the folder belongs when creating a new group folder.
  Group folders must belong to a group. However, it does not play any
  role when creating a user folder.

Explore folder
--------------

You can click the folder icon in the Control panel to bring up a file explorer
where you can view the contents of that folder.

.. image:: vfolder_item_with_controls.png
   :alt: Controls in folder item

You can see that directories and files inside the folder will be listed, if
exists. Click a directory name in the Name panel to move to the directory.  You
can click the download button or delete button in the Actions panel to download
it or delete it entirely from the directory. You can rename a file/directory as
well. For more detailed file operations, you can mount this folder when creating
a compute session, and then use a service like Terminal or Jupyter Notebook to
do it.

.. image:: vfolder_explorer.png
   :alt: File explorer of a storage folder

You can create a new directory on the current path with the NEW FOLDER button
(in the file explorer), or upload a local file with the UPLOAD FILES button. All
of these file operations can also be performed using the above-described method
of mounting folders into a compute session.

The maximum length of file or directory inside a folder may depends on the host
file system. But, it usually cannot exceed 255 characters.

To close file explorer, click the X button in the upper right.


Rename folder
-------------

If you have permission to rename the storage folder, you can rename it by
clicking the edit icon in the Control panel. When you click the icon button, a
rename dialog will appear. Write new folder name and then click RENAME button.


Delete folder
-------------

If you have permission to delete the storage folder, you can delete it by
clicking the trash can icon in the Control panel. When you click the Delete
button, a confirm dialog appears. To prevent accidental deletion, you have to
enter the name of the folder to be deleted, explicitly.

The folders created here can be mounted when creating a compute session. Folders
are mounted under the user's default working directory, ``/home/work/``, and the
files stored in the mounted directory will not be deleted when the compute session
is terminated. (However, if you delete the folder itself, it will be gone).


.. _automount-folder:

Automount folder
----------------

Data & Storage page has an Automount Folders tab. Click this tab to see a
list of folders whose names prefixed with a dot (.). When you create a folder,
if you specify a name that starts with a dot (.), it is added to the Automount
Folders tab, not the Folders tab. Automount Folders are special folders that are
automatically mounted in your home directory even if you do not mount them
manually when creating a compute session. By using this feature, creating and
using Storage folders such as ``.local``, ``.linuxbrew``, ``.pyenv``, etc.,
you can configure a certain user packages or environments that do not change
with different kinds of compute session.

For more detailed information on the usage of Automount folders, refer to
:ref:`examples of using automount folders<using-automount-folder>`.

Using Filebrowser
-----------------

Backend.AI provides filebrowser from ``20.09``. filebrowser is an useful application when uploading
one or more folders.

Currently, filebrowser is one of the applications that can be executed via session.
Please check your Backend.AI status suits to the following requirements.

- capable of creating at least one or more sessions

- minimum 1 core of CPU and 0.5 GB of RAM

- Image that supports filebrowser has been installed

You can access filebrowser in two ways.

- Execute filebrowser in each Vfolder explorer

- Create a session with filebrowser supporting image


Execute filebrowser in each Vfolder explorer
============================================

To execute filebrowser, you need to open folder explorer first.
Click the folder icon in Controls panel of the Vfolder.

.. image:: first_step_to_access_filebrowser.png
   :alt: First step to access filebrowser

.. warning::
   Filebrowser is not available in Vfolder with read-only permission.

Click EXECUTE FILEBROWSER button in the right-top of the folder explorer.

.. image:: folderexplorer_with_filebrowser.png
   :alt: Folder explorer with filebrowser

You can see the file browser is opened in a new window.

.. image:: filebrowser_with_new_window.png
   :alt: Filebrowser with new window

Vfolder becomes the ``root`` directory when the filebrowser is launched.
You can see the session is running in the session page.

.. image:: filebrowser_in_session_page.png
   :alt: Filebrowser in session page

.. note::
   If you close the filebrowser window by accident and try to reopen the filebrowser,
   just go to sessions page and click the filebrowser application of the running session
   with filebrowser image. 
   
   .. image:: app_dialog_with_filebrowser.png
      :align: center

   |
   | When you click EXECUTE FILEBROWSER button again, It will create another session.


Create a session with filebrowser image
=======================================

You can create a session with filebrowser supported images.
When creating a session for using a filebrowser, following resource allocation
is highly recommended.

- CPU : 1 core

- RAM : 0.5 GB


Also, you need to mount at least one or more Vfolders to access them.
If you don't mount Vfolders you can still use filebrowser, but every uploaded file or folders
by filebrowser application will be gone after the session is terminated.

.. note::
   the ``root`` directory of filebrowser that created by session page is ``/home/work``.
   Therefore, you need to access to mounted Vfolder first to upload or download any file or folder.


In filebrowser, It provides more than folder explorer supports,
such as uploading folder and moving files, folders.

Upload folder using filebrowser
===============================

Filebrowser supports uploading one or more folders while maintaining the structure
of each directory. Click UPLOAD button in the right top of the window, and click Folder button.
Then, folder explorer will appear and you can upload any folder you want.

.. image:: filebrowser_upload.png
   :align: center

Let's upload folder with the following structure.

.. code-block:: shell

   foo
   +-- test
   |Â    +-- test2.txt
   +-- test.txt


You can see the folder just uploaded successfully.

.. image:: filebrowser_upload_finished.png

Also, you can upload files and folders by drag and drop mode.


Moving files or folders to another directory
============================================

Moving files or folders in Vfolder is also available in filebrowser.
You can move files or folders following steps below.

1. Select folders or files

.. image:: select_folders.png
   :align: center

2. Click the arrow icon in the right top of filebrowser

.. image:: click_arrow_icon.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center

3. Select the destination

.. image:: select_the_destination.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center

4. Click MOVE button


You can see that moving operation is successfully finished.

.. image:: moving_operation_in_filebrowser_finished.png
   :align: center

.. note::
   If any file or folders are already exists in the destination, numbering such as (1) or (2)... will be appended.


.. note::
   Filebrowser is provided via application in a session as for now,
   We are planning to update filebrowser so that it can run independently
   without creating a session.
