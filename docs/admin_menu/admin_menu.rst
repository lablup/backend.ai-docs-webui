Admin Menus
===========

When you log in with an admin account, you will see an additional Administration
menu in the bottom left sidebar. User information registered in Backend.AI is
listed in the Users tab. Domain admin can see only the users who belong to the domain,
while superadmin can see all users' information. Only
superadmin can create and deactivate a user.

User ID (email) and Name (username) can be filtered by typing text in the
search box on each column header.

   :alt: User management page


Create and update users
-----------------------

A user can be created by clicking the CREATE USER button. Note that the password
must be longer or equal to 8 characters and at least 1 alphabet/special
character/ number should be included. The maximum length allowed for E-Mail and Username is 64.

.. note::

   If a user with the same email or username already exists, it is not possible to
   creat user account. Please try other email and username.

.. image:: create_user_dialog.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center
   :alt: Create user dialog

Check if the user is created.

.. image:: check_if_user_created.png
   :alt: User management page

Click the green button in the Controls panel for more detailed user
information. You can also check the domain and group information where the
user belongs.

.. image:: user_detail_dialog.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center
   :alt: Detailed information of a user

Click the gear icon in the Controls panel to update information of a user who
already exists. User's name, password, activation state, etc. can be changed. User ID cannot be changed.

.. image:: user_update_dialog.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: User update dialog

Each of the two items at the bottom of the dialog has the following functions.

* Active user?: Indicates the user's active status. Inactive users cannot log
  in. You can toggle this option to change the user to active or inactive state.
  Note that the inactive users are listed in the Inactive tab separately.
* Require password change?: If the admin has chosen random passwords while
  creating users in batches, this field can be set to ON to indicate that password change is required.
  This is a kind of descriptive flag and has no effect on actual use.

Inactivate user account
-----------------------

Deleting user accounts is not allowed even for superadmins, to track usage
statistics per user, metric retention, and accidental account loss. Instead,
admins can inactivate user accounts to keep users from logging in. Click the
trash icon in the Controls panel. A dialog asking confirmation appears, and
you can inactivate the user by clicking the OKAY button.

.. image:: user_deactivate_confirmation.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center
   :alt: Deactivating user account

To re-activate users, go to Users - Inactive tab, and edit the target user to
turn on "Active user?" field.

.. note::

   Please note that inactivating the user changes all of credentials to be inactive,
   but reactivating the user does not reactivate the inactivated credentials, since the user
   account can have multiple keypairs, which brings it hard to decide which credential
   should be reactivated.


Manage User's Keypairs
----------------------

Each user account usually have one or more keypairs. A keypair is used for API
authentication to the Backend.AI server, after user logs in. Login requires
authentication via user email and password, but every request the user sends to
the server is authenticated based on the keypair.

A user can have multiple keypairs, but to reduce the user's burden of managing
keypairs, we are currently using only one of the user's keypairs to send requests.
Also, when you create a new user, a keypair is automatically created, so you do
not need to create and assign a keypair manually in most cases.

Keypairs can be listed on the Credentials tab of in the Users page. Active
keypairs are shown immediately, and to see the inactive keypairs, click the
Inactive panel at the bottom.

.. image:: credential_list_tab.png
   :alt: Credential list page

Like in Users tab, you can use the buttons in the Controls panel to view or
update keypair details. Click the blue trash button to disable that keypair, or
click the red trash button to completely delete the keypair. However, if you
have created a compute session using a keypair, you cannot delete it. If you
accidentally deleted a keypair, you can re-create keypair for the user by
clicking the ADD CREDENTIAL button at the upper right corner. If necessary, you
can also explicitly enter the access key and secret key by clicking the Advanced
panel.

The Rate Limit field is where you specify the maximum number of requests that
can be sent to the Backend.AI server in 15 minutes. For example, if set to 1000,
and the keypair sends more than 1000 API requests in 15 minutes, and the server
throws an error and does not accept the request. It is recommended to use the
default value and increase it when the API request frequency goes up high
according to the user's pattern.

.. _sharing-a-group-storage:

Share group storage folders with group members
-------------------------------------------------

Backend.AI provides storage folders for groups, in addition to user's own
storage folder. A group storage folder is a folder belonging to a specific
group, not a specific user, and can be accessed by all users in that group.

.. note::
   Group folders can be created only by administrators. Normal users can only
   access the contents of the group folder created by the administrator.
   Depending on the system settings, group folders may not be allowed.

First, log in with an admin account and create a group folder. After
moving to the Data & Storage page, click NEW FOLDER to open the folder creation
dialog. Enter the folder name, set the Type to Group, and select the group to share the folder.
Let's select the group to which User B belongs for
this example to work. Permission is set to Read-Only..

.. image:: group_folder_creation.png
   :width: 450
   :align: center

After confirming that the folder has been created, log in with the User B's
account and check that the group folder just created on the Data & Storage page
is displayed without any invitation procedure. You can see that R (Read Only) is
also displayed in the Permission panel.

.. image:: group_folder_listed_in_B.png

Manage Resource Policy
----------------------

In Backend.AI, admins can set a limit on the total amount of resources available
for each user and group. Resource limits per group can only be set through the
enterprise-dedicated administrator GUI Control-Panel, but resource limits per user
(precisely per user's keypair) can be set in the user Web-UI.

Resource policies allow you to set maximum allowed resources and/or
other compute session related settings per keypair basis. If necessary, multiple
resource policies can be created, for example, user / research purposes, and
apply them separately to each keypair.

.. note::
   To set resource policies at the domain and group level, you have to use
   admin Control-Panel, a UI for superadmin only. In the Web-UI, you can only set
   resource policies based on keypairs. Control-Panel is a part of the
   enterprise version.

In Resource Policies tab on the Users page, the admin can check the list of
currently registered resource policies.  In the figure below, there are a total
of three policies (gardener, STUDENT, default).  The infinity (∞) marks for
resources such as Cores, Ram, and fGPU in the Resources panel means that no
resource restrictions have been placed for those resources.

.. image:: resource_policy_page.png
   :alt: Resource policy page

The user account currently used in this guide is under the default
resource policy. This can be confirmed in the Credentials tab on the left. In the Resource Policy panel,
you can also see that all resources can be used to the extent the hardware allows (∞).

.. image:: credentials.png

You can modify resouce policies by clicking the gear button in the Control panel of default policy group.
In Update Resource Policy dialog, every option is
changeable except Policy Name, which is the primary key for distinguishing the
resource policies in the list. Uncheck the Unlimited checkbox at the bottom of CPU, RAM, fGPU, and set the resource limits
to the desired values. Set the amount of allocated resource to be smaller than
the total amount of hardware's. Here, CPU, RAM and fGPU are set to 2, 4 and 1, respectively. Click
the UPDATE button to update the resource policy.

.. image:: update_resource_policy.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center
   :alt: Update resource policy dialog

About details of each option in resource policy dialog, see the description below.

* Resource Policy
   * CPU:  Specify the maximum amount of CPU cores. (max value: 512)
   * RAM: Specify the maximum amount of memory in GB. It would be good practice
     to set memory twice as large as the maximum value of GPU memory. (max value: 1024)
   * GPU: Specify the maximum amount of physical GPUs. If fractional GPU is
     enabled by the server, this setting has no effect. (max value: 64)
   * fGPU: Fractional GPU (fGPU) is literally split a single GPU to multiple
     partitions in order to use GPU efficiently. Notice that the minimum amount
     of fGPU required is differed by each image. If fractional GPU is not
     enabled by the server, this settings has no effect. (max value: 256)

* Sessions
   * Container Per Session: The maximum number of containers per session.
     Currently, this value has no effect since the server only allows one
     container per compute session. (max value: 100)
   * Idle timeout (sec.): Configurable period of time during which the user can
     leave their session untouched. If there is no activity at
     all on a compute session for idle timeout, the session will be garbage
     collected and destroyed automatically.(max value: 15552000 (approx. 180 days))
   * Concurrent Jobs: Maximum number of concurrent compute session per keypair.
     If this value is set to 3, for example, users bound to this resource policy
     cannot create more than 3 compute sessions simultaneously. (max value: 100)

* Folders
   * Allowed hosts: Backend.AI supports many NFS mountpoint. This field limits
     the accessibility to them. Even if a NFS named "data-1" is mounted on
     Backend.AI, users cannot access it unless it is allowed by resource policy.
   * Capacity (GB): the maximum size (GB) a storage folder can contain. This
     feature is only effective for special type of storages/filesystems such as
     FlashBlade. (max value: 1024)
   * Max. #: the maximum number of storage folders that can be created/invited.
     (max value: 50)

In the resource policy list, check that the Resources value of the default
policy has been updated.

.. image:: update_check.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center

You can create a new resource policy by clicking the CREATE POLICY button. Each
setting value is the same as described above.

To create a resource policy and associate it with a keypair, go to the
Credentials tab of the Users page, click the gear button located in the
Controls panel of the desired keypair, and click the Select Policy field to
choose it.

You can also delete each of resource keypairs by clicking trash can icon
in the Control panel. When you click the icon, the confirmation dialog will appears.
click OKAY button to delete.

.. image:: resource_policy_delete_dialog.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center

.. note::

   If there's any users (including inactive users) following a resource policy to be deleted,
   deletion may not be done. Before deleting a resource policy, please make sure that
   no users remain under the resource policy.


.. note::

   In each of USERS, CREDENTIALS, RESOURCE POLICIES tabs, there is an icon
   (``...``) on the right side of the tab header. Clicking this shows
   export CSV menu, which again brings up a CSV export dialog for each tabs.
   By giving an appropriate file name, if necessary, and clicking EXPORT CSV FILE
   button, you can download the list of users, keypairs, and/or resource
   policies.

    .. image:: export_csv_user.png
       :width: 400
       :align: center


Manage Images
-------------

Admins can manage images, which are used in creating a compute session, in the
Images tab of the Environments page. In the tab, meta information of all images
currently in the Backend.AI server is displayed. You can check information such
as registry, namespace, image name, image's based OS, digest, and minimum
resources required for each image. For images downloaded to one or more agent
nodes, there will be a ``installed`` tag in each Status column.

.. note::
   The feature to install images by selecting specific agents is currently
   under development.

.. image:: image_list_page.png
   :alt: Image list page

You can change the minimum resource requirements for each image by clicking the
gear icon in the Controls panel. Each image has hardware and resource
requirements for minimal operation. (For example, for GPU-only images, there
must be a minimum allocated GPU.) The default value for the minimum resource
amount is provided as embedded in the image's metadata. If an attempt is made to
create a compute session with a resource that is less than the amount of
resources specified in each image, the request is automatically adjusted to the
minimum resource requirements for the image and then generated, not canceled.

.. warning::
   Don't change the minimum resource requirements to an amount less than the
   predefined value! The minimum resource requirements included in the image
   metadata are values that have been tested and determined. If you are not
   really sure about the minimum amount of resources you want to change, leave
   it in the default.

.. image:: update_image_resource_setting.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: Update image resource setting


Manager docker registry
-----------------------

You can click on the Registries tab in Environments page to see the information
of the docker registry that are currently connected. ``cr.backend.ai`` is
registered by default, and it is a registry provided by Harbor.

.. note::
   In the offline environment, the default registry is not accessible, so
   click the trash icon on the right to delete it.

Click the refresh icon in Controls to update image metadata for Backend.AI from
the connected registry. Image information which does not have labels for
Backend.AI among the images stored in the registry is not updated.

.. image:: image_registries_page.png
   :alt: Registries page

You can add your own private docker registry by clicking the ADD REGISTRY
button. Note that Registry Hostname and Registry URL address must be set
identically, and in the case of Registry URL, a scheme such as ``http://`` or
``https://`` must be explicitly attached. Also, images stored in the registry
must have a name prefixed with Registry Hostname. Username and Password are
optional and can be filled in if you set separate authentication settings in the
registry.

.. image:: add_registry_dialog.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: Add registry dialog

Even if you created a registry and update meta information, users cannot use the
images in the registry, immediately. Just as you had to register the allowed hosts
to use the storage host, you must register the registry in the allowed docker
registries field at the domain or group level, after registering the registry,
so that users in the domain or group can access the registry image. Allowed
docker registries can be registered using the Control-Panel with domain and group
management. The function to set the allowed docker registries in the keypair's
resource policy is not provided yet.


Manage resource preset
----------------------

The following predefined resource presets are displayed in the Resource
allocation panel when creating a compute session. Superadmin can manage these
resource presets.

.. image:: resource_presets_in_resource_monitor.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: Resource presets in compute session launch dialog

Go to the Resource Presets tab on the Environment page. You can check the list
of currently defined resource presets.

.. image:: resource_preset_list.png
   :alt: Resource presets tab

You can set resources such as CPU, RAM, fGPU, etc. to be provided by the
resource preset by clicking the gear icon (cogwheel) in the Controls panel.
In the example below, the GPU field is disabled since the GPU provision mode of
the Backend.AI server is set to "fractional". After setting the resources with
the desired values, save it and check if the corresponding preset is displayed
when creating a compute session. If available resources are less
than the amount of resources defined in the preset, the corresponding preset
would not be shown.

.. image:: modify_resource_preset_dialog.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: Modify resource preset dialog

Also you can create resource preset by Clicking CREATE PRESETS button in the
right top of the Resource Presets tab. You cannot create the same resource
preset name that already exists, since it is the key value for distinguishing
each resource preset.

.. image:: create_resource_preset_dialog.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: Create resource preset dialog


Query agent nodes
-----------------

Superadmins can view the list of agent worker nodes, currently connected to
Backend.AI, by visiting the Resources page. You can check agent node's IP,
connecting time, actual resources currently in use, etc. The Web-UI does
not provide the function to manipulate agent nodes.

.. image:: agent_list.png
   :alt: Agent node list

Also You can see exact usage about the resources in the agent worker node
by Click note icon in the Control panel.

.. image:: detailed_agent_node_usage_information.png
   :alt: Detailed agent node usage information

On Terminated tab, you can check the information of the agents that has been
connected once and then terminated or disconnected. It can be used as a
reference for node management. If the list is empty, then It means
that there's no disconnection or termination occurred.

.. image:: terminated_agent_list.png
   :alt: Terminated agent node list

.. _scheduling-methods:

Manage resource group
---------------------

Agents can be grouped into units called resource (scaling) groups. For example,
let's say there are 3 agents with V100 GPUs and 2 agents with P100 GPUs. You
want to expose two types of GPUs to users separately, then you can group three
V100 agents into one resource group, and the remaining two P100 agents into
another resource group.

Adding a specific agent to a specific resource group is not currently handled in
the UI, and it can be done by editing agent config file from the installation
location and restart the agent daemon. Management of the resource groups is
possible in Scaling Group tab of the Resource page.

.. image:: scaling_group_tab.png
   :alt: Resource group tab

You can edit a resource group by clicking the gear icon in the Control
panel. In the Select scheduler field, you can choose the scheduling method for
creating a compute session. Currently, there are three types: ``FIFO``, ``LIFO``, and
``DRF``. ``FIFO`` and ``LIFO`` are scheduling methods creating the first- or the
last-enqueued compute session in the job queue. ``DRF`` stands for Dominant Resource
Fairness, and it aims to provide resources as fair as possible for each user.
You can deactivate a resource policy by turning off Active Status.

.. image:: modify_resource_group.png
   :alt: Modify resource group dialog

You can create a new resource policy by clicking the CREATE button.
Likewise other creating options, you cannot create a resource policy with the name
that already exists, since name is the key value.

.. image:: create_resource_group.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center
   :alt: Create resource group dialog


Download session lists
----------------------

There's additional feature in Session page for admin.
On the right side of the OTHERS tab there is a menu marked with ``...``.
When you click this menu, a sub-menu export CSV appears.

.. image:: export_csv_menu.png

If you click this menu, you can download the information of the comcpute sessions
created so far in CSV format. After the following dialog opens, enter an appropriate
file name (if necessary), click the EXPORT button and you will get the CSV file.
Please note that a file name can have up to 255 characters.

.. image:: export_session_dialog.png
   :width: 350
   :align: center


System settings
---------------

In the System Settings page, you can see main settings of Backend.AI server.
Currently, it provides several controls which can change and list settings.


You can change image auto install and update rule by selecting one option from
``Digest``, ``Tag``, ``None``. ``Digest`` is kind of checksum for the image which
verifies integrity of the image and also enhances  efficiency in downloading images
by reusing duplicated layers. ``Tag`` is only for developing option since it does not
guarantee the Integrity of the image.


.. warning::
   Don't change rule selection unless you completely understand the meaning of each rule.

.. image:: system_setting_about_image.png
   :alt: System setting about image

You can also choose job scheduler. Currently, there are three types: ``FIFO``, ``LIFO``,
and ``DRF``. Each method of the scheduling is exactly same as
:ref:`scheduling methods<scheduling-methods>` above.

.. image:: system_setting_about_scaling_plugins.png
   :alt: System setting about scaling and plugins

.. note::
   We will continue to add broader range of setting controls.


Server management
-----------------

Go to the Maintenance page and you will see some buttons to manage the server.

- RECALCULATE USAGE: Occasionally, due to unstable network connections or
  container management problem of Docker daemon, there may be a case where the
  resource occupied by Backend.AI does not match the resource actually used by
  the container. In this case, click the RECALCULATE USAGE button to manually
  correct the resource occupancy.
- RESCAN IMAGES: Update image meta information from all registered Docker
  registries. It can be used when a new image is pushed to a
  Backend.AI-connected docker registry.

.. image:: maintenance_page.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center
   :alt: Maintenance page

.. note::
   We will continue to add other settings needed for management, such as
   removing unused images or registering periodic maintenance schedules.


Detailed Information
---------------------

In Information page, you can see several detailed information and status of each feature.
To see Manager version and API version, check the Core panel. To see whether each component
for Backend.AI is compatible or not, check the Component panel.
