Installation
============

The Web-UI can be used in two forms. It can be used as a web service by
connecting to a separate web address prepared by the admins, or as an
app provided as a stand-alone executable file that does not require separate
installation.

With the web-based Web-UI, users do not need to install a
platform-dependent desktop applications and just need the latest versions of
browsers such as Chrome.

* Recommended browser: the latest version of Chrome (at least version > 80)
* Requirement: any machine that runs Web Browser (2 cores, 4 GiB memory)

.. note::
   We do not support MicroSoft Internet Explorer since it
   is deprecated and does not follow web standard and support up-to-date brower
   features.

The stand-alone Web-UI app can be downloaded from following address:

.. note::
   In the case of an app, depending on the security setting of the
   desktop OS, it may be recognized as an unsigned executable file
   and a permission check may be required.
